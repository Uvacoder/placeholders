# Placeholder

Web components to replace content with placeholder.

For example, placing a paragraph inside a `<placeholder-text>` tag

``` html
<placeholder-text>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ...</placeholder-text>
```

will turn each text into a rectangle with the same size as following:

![Text placeholder](assets/text-placeholder.png)
