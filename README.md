# Placeholder

Custom placeholders in web components. Can be used with popular JavaScript frameworks or HTML tags.

## Usage

Insert the following script tag to your page:

``` html
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@placeholders/core@0.0.1/dist/esm/placeholders.js"></script>
```

Then you can use `<placeholder-xxx>` tags. For example:

``` html
<placeholder-text>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet ...
</placeholder-text>
```

will turn each text into a rectangle with the same size as following:

![Text placeholder](assets/text-placeholder.png)
